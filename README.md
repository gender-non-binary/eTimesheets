Hey :)
This is my project for year 12 computing 2018, docs can be found in /docs or at [https://non-bin.github.io/eTimesheets/](https://non-bin.github.io/eTimesheets/)

# Using the software

to run a server, execute the `start.sh` script, or run in a php7 enabled webserver with only the `./eTimesheets/public/` folder available

If run with `start.sh`, `php -S 0.0.0.0:3000 -t ./eTimesheets/public` or similar, some feedback is logged to the terminal
